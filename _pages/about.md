Hey there! Welcome to my personal website.  
====

I am a fifth-year Economics Ph.D. student at [Universidad Carlos III de Madrid](http://economics.uc3m.es/). 

I work on Econometrics. My research interests span identification, estimation, and inference of Semiparametric Models, and I am especially interested in causal inference with Machine Learning. 

This is my [cv](http://argafacu.github.io/files/CV_FacundoArga_araz.pdf).
