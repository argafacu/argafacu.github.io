Hey there! Welcome to my personal website.  
====

I am Ph.D. candidate in Economics at [Universidad Carlos III de Madrid](http://economics.uc3m.es/). 

I work on Econometrics. My research interests span identification, estimation, and inference of semiparametric models, and I am especially interested in causal inference using machine learning.

I am on the **Academic Job Market 2024-2025**. 

My Job Market Paper is [Automatic Debiased Machine Learning of Structural Parameters with General Conditional Moments (2024)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DjzGPdIens-Wrpfc6JrvFUWu71lnj7zg/view?usp=drive_link).


This is my [cv](http://argafacu.github.io/files/cvFacundoArganaraz.pdf).
