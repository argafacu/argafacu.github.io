Hey there! Welcome to my personal website.  
====

I work on Econometrics. My research interests span identification, estimation, and inference of semiparametric models, and I am especially interested in causal inference using machine learning.

In the Fall of 2025, I will join the [Department of Economics at Sciences Po, Paris](https://www.sciencespo.fr/department-economics/) as an Assistant Professor. 

In Spring 2024, I visited [The University of Chicago Booth School of Business](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/) as a Ph.D. student.

This is my [cv](http://argafacu.github.io/files/cvFacundoArganaraz.pdf).
