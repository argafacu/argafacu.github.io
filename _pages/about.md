Hey there! Welcome to my personal website.  
====

I am a fifth-year Economics Ph.D. student at [Universidad Carlos III de Madrid](http://economics.uc3m.es/). 

I work on Econometrics. My research interests span identification, estimation, and inference of semiparametric models, and I am especially interested in causal inference with machine learning.

I am writing my dissertation under the supervision of Prof. [Juan Carlos Escanciano.](https://sites.google.com/view/juancarlosescanciano/home)

During the Spring of 2024, I will be visiting [The University of Chicago Booth School of Business](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/).

I will be on the Academic Job Market 2024-2025. 

This is my [cv](http://argafacu.github.io/files/CV_FacundoArga_araz.pdf).
