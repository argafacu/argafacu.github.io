Hey there! Welcome to my personal website.  
====

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at [Universidad Carlos III de Madrid](http://economics.uc3m.es/). 

I work on Econometrics. My research interests span identification, estimation, and inference of semiparametric models, and I am especially interested in causal inference using machine learning.

In the Fall of 2025, I will join the Department of Economics at Sciences Po, Paris as an Assistant Professor. 

In Spring 2024, I visited [The University of Chicago Booth School of Business](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/).

This is my [cv](http://argafacu.github.io/files/cvFacundoArganaraz.pdf).
