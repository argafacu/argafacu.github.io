Hey there! Welcome to my personal website.  
====
I am an Assitant Professor of the [Department of Economics at Sciences Po, Paris](https://www.sciencespo.fr/department-economics/)  

I work on Econometrics. My research interests span identification, estimation, and inference of semiparametric models, and I am especially interested in causal inference using machine learning.

This is my [cv](http://argafacu.github.io/files/cvFacundoArganaraz.pdf).
