        Abstract
      </summary>
This paper provides an automatic construction for debiasing moments in general semiparametric models defined by several conditional moment restrictions, with possibly different conditioning variables and endogenous regressors. The construction is automatic in the sense that orthogonal moments are obtained using a data-driven algorithm and exploiting the initial identifying moments only. Our approach, among the large number of possible instruments, automatically selects instrument functions that guarantee orthogonality. Therefore, our methodology does not require finding closed-form expressions for the locally robust moments, which might be challenging in practice, or an "ad-hoc" selection of instruments. We apply our proposed approach to the estimation of production functions at the firm level, revisiting the model introduced by the seminal work of Olley and Pakes (1996). Through numerical experimentation and real data of Chilean firms, we assess the relative performance of our estimator relative to a standard approach in the literature: the estimator introduced by Ackerberg et al. (2015).  Our results indicate that, if first stages bias is not properly accounted for, one can obtain incorrect and non-reliable conclusions about input elasticities. In addition, our method is able to uncover much more heterogeneity in production functions across industries than previously recognized. Finally, first-stage bias could also lead to misleading conclusions about the evolution of productivity in the economy, which is a central object for designing public policies in several contexts. This highlights the relevance of our new estimator.

        Abstract
      </summary>
Locally Robust (LR)/Orthogonal/Debiased moments have proven useful with machine learning first steps, but their existence has not been investigated for general parameters. In this paper, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition, referred to as Restricted Local Non-surjectivity (RLN), for the existence of such orthogonal moments to conduct robust
inference on general parameters of interest in regular semiparametric models. In addition, we study when score-type tests based on orthogonal moments are locally informative at
the parametric rate. We demonstrate the utility of our general results by characterizing orthogonal moments in a class of models with unobserved heterogeneity (UH). Orthogonality
for general smooth functionals of the distribution of UH is also characterized. As a second major application, we find orthogonal moments for general conditional moments models,
including the fully saturated two stage least squares, heterogeneous parameters in treatment effects, sample selection models, and popular models of demand for differentiated
products. We apply our results to the Oregon Health Experiment to study heterogeneous treatment effects of Medicaid on different health outcomes.

        Abstract
      </summary>
    This paper introduces a fully non-parametric approach for forecasting binary variables in a static panel data setting with strictly exogenous regressors, where N is large while T does not need to be large. The method does not make any assumption about the distribution of the errors of the model, the distribution of the individual effects, or even how the regressors and the associated parameters affect the dependent variable. The novelty of the technique relies on exploiting a sufficient statistic and using the fact that, under suitable conditions, this variable approximately follows the Poisson distribution. Built on this approximation, the approach applies the Tweedie's Formula, which allows identifying the one-step-ahead forecast of the outcome variable in this non-linear framework. The proposal can be easily extended to obtain predictions h-steps ahead. By means of numerous simulation exercises, the paper shows that the Tweedie's Forecast can achieve desirable forecast properties and be a satisfactory competitor against usual probit and logit models, regardless of numerous features of the data. Furthermore, this study applies the proposed approach to predict different health attributes (both physical and mental) for Spanish older adults, using grip strength as the predictor. Once again, the evidence indicates that the Tweedie's Forecast is able to systematically achieve good relative forecast accuracy.

        Abstract
      </summary>
      In this paper, both a theoretical and an empirical model to study the contribution of productivity and management practices on exporter status are presented. On the theoretical side, a multiple heterogeneity model is developed, where firms can differ in their levels of two dierent kinds of productivity: in cost and in management, in a context of monopolistic competition. With this, in the autarkic case, the model achieves two conditions (Zero Cut-Off Profitt Condition and Free Entry Condition) that firstly determine which firms enter and produce in the market. Then, by opening the economy to the rest of the world, the model not only shows which firms survive in the domestic market but also which ones export. Therefore, the most productive firms would not necessarily export, because export decision also depends on how efectively firms carry out a set of management practices to adapt their product to foreign demand. On the empirical side, productivity and management practices at firm level are measured by using several methods and specications to identify their efect on exporter status, exploiting the waves of The World Bank Enterprise Surveys of 2006, 2010 and 2017 for Argentina. The main results indicate that both productivity and management practices
affect positively the probability of being an exporter, and their effects are very similar in magnitude. Thanks to my work, I have identied some particular strategies firms should mainly focus on. Indeed, I suggest that obtaining ISO certications, offering training programs to employees and using services or programs to promote exports are important for being an exporter.
